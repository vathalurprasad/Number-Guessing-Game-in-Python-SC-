# Number Guessing Game 

This is a fun and interactive Python project where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

##  Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- User gets unlimited attempts to guess the number.
- Provides feedback whether the guess is too low or too high.
- Tracks the number of attempts taken.
- Handles invalid (non-integer) inputs gracefully.

##  How to Run
1. Open the script in your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, IDLE).
2. Run the code.
3. Input your guesses when prompted until you guess the correct number.

##  Example Output
 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have picked a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
 Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 30
 Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 42
 Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.

##  Learning Outcomes
- Using `random` module in Python.
- Using loops and conditionals effectively.
- Input handling and exception management.
- User interaction via the terminal.
